# SIMULATED ANNEALING ALGORITHM
# =============================================================================

'''
Simulated Annealing is inspired by the physical process of annealing, where metals are slowly cooled to 
reduce imperfections. There are several hyperparameters that can be tuned to affect the algorithm's performance:
    - Cooling Rate: 
        This value controls how quickly the temperature is reduced during the optimization process. 
        A higher cooling rate leads to faster cooling, potentially getting stuck in local minima. 
        A slower cooling rate allows for more exploration but might take longer to converge.
    - Number of Iterations: 
        This defines the number of times the algorithm iterates through the loop, generating and evaluating 
        candidate solutions. More iterations allow for more exploration but also take longer to run.
    - Bounds: 
        These define the search space for the variables (x and y in this case). 
        Choosing appropriate bounds can restrict the algorithm to a relevant region and improve efficiency.
        
Here's a breakdown of cooling rates:
    - High cooling rate (above 1): 
        Not possible. The cooling rate represents the factor by which the temperature is multiplied at 
        each iteration. A value greater than 1 would actually cause the temperature to increase, 
        which wouldn't be cooling at all.
    - Medium cooling rate (around 0.8 - 0.99): 
        This is a common range used in practice. It allows for a balance between exploration (finding new solutions) 
        and exploitation (converging towards the best solution found so far).
    - Low cooling rate (below 0.8): 
        This leads to slower cooling, allowing the algorithm to explore the search space more thoroughly. 
        This can be helpful for complex problems with many local minima, but it also increases the computation time.

Here's a breakdown of bounds:
    - For 1 variable (x):
        Define a single tuple with two elements representing the lower and upper bounds. 
        Eg: bounds = (-5, 5))
    - For 2 varialbes (x, y): 
        Define a list containing two tuples, each representing the bounds for a single variable. 
        Eg: bounds = [(-5, 5), (-2, 2)]
    - For 3 variables (x,y,z): 
        Define a list containing three tuples, each representing the bounds for a single variable.
        Eg: bounds = [(-5, 5), (-2, 2), (-1, 3)]
